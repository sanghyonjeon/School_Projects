In the final project of OOP345, I implemented an assembly line that
fills customer orders from an inventory. The project covered various
aspects of C++ programming including handling raw memory, reading data
from files, creating and managing classes, object-oriented programming,
and using various STL containers. It was an incredibly enriching
experience and pushed me to apply all the knowledge I'd garnered
throughout the course.

In Milestone 1, I implemented two modules: Utilities and Station. The
Utilities module extracted tokens from strings and the Station module
managed an inventory of products. I had to manage a static variable for
field width and provide functions to manipulate and fetch this variable.
I learned how to deal with static class members and how they can be used
to share data across all instances of a class. The Station module was
designed to simulate an inventory system, so it was important to
properly manage data within it and maintain the integrity of the
inventory.

For the second milestone, I designed the CustomerOrder class. This class
was complex, containing a nested Item struct and a dynamically allocated
array of pointers. This taught me to carefully manage dynamic memory in
C++ and ensure there were no memory leaks. I had to implement the Rule
of Five, including custom constructors, a move constructor, and move
assignment operator while disabling copy operations.

The third milestone included two modules: Workstation and LineManager.
Workstation was derived from Station and managed the processing of
orders. LineManager managed the active stations and orders. These
modules taught me how to design and manage complex systems and how to
interact with them in an efficient manner. Understanding how to
efficiently manage and process objects in different stages was a
significant part of this milestone.

Overall, the final project was a deep dive into C++ programming,
exploring the topics of dynamic memory management, inheritance,
encapsulation, data extraction, STL containers, and operator overloading
among other concepts. This project made me understand the importance of
design decisions, memory management, and most importantly, how to create
complex yet efficient systems using object-oriented programming in C++.
It was truly an eye-opening experience that I believe has prepared me
to tackle real-world problems using C++.

Reflecting on the OOP345 course, I feel incredibly fortunate for having
switched into this class under the guidance of such an organized,
knowledgeable, and accessible instructor. The switch at the beginning of
the course turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made, as our
instructor genuinely cared about each student's learning progress. His
unique teaching approach made every class enjoyable, despite the
course's complexity which, I'll admit, led to (many) moments of
hair-pulling and tears (of pure joy, of course T_T). But, Professor Hong
Huang masterfully ensured that we had a healthy dose of "fun" mixed with
the challenges. It sure was a journey of learning, some laughter, and
loads of "fun" – a journey that I am grateful to have taken.
